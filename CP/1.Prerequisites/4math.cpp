imagine that everything in this universe was suddenly destroyed in a cataclysmic explosion, leaving nothing but two rectangles 
 on an endless plane. These two rectangles have their corners at integer co-ordinates . 
 Your task is to discover the total area of the plane which is covered by these rectangles.

Beware! Some parts of the plane may be covered by both rectangles. 
If you merely add the individual areas together, you are surely doomed to incorrect answers!

Input
The input will consist of two lines. 
Each line will be of the form x1 y1 x2 y2, describing the bottom-left and top-right corners of one rectangle. 
You are guaranteed that 0 <= x1 < x2 <= 10,000, and 0 <= y1 < y2 <= 10,000. (That is, each rectangle is at least one unit square in size.)

Output
Your output should consist of a single integer: the total area covered by rectangles. (Remember - the rectangles may overlap!)

Sample Input
1 1 3 4
2 3 6 7
Sample Output
